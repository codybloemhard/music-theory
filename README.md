# Music Theory

Rust library for music theory objects and queries.
provides:
  - music theory objects such as notes, enharmonic notes, pitchclasses, intervals, scales and chords
  - conversions between these objects
  - ways to print and format these objects
  - queries such as:
    - finding scale chords
    - finding scales
    - finding super strings and super sets
    - finding chord scales
    - finding sub chords

I maintain a test coverage of 100%.
This does not mean no bugs exist, but trying to write good tests is a priority.

The [theory frog](https://codyb.xyz/theory-frog.html) web app is made using this library.
It shows some the things it can do.
